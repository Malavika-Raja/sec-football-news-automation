# SEC Football Weekly News Automation

## Overview

This project is a small Python automation that collects SEC college football news from a public SEC Sports API endpoint, filters articles from the last 7 days, formats them into a readable summary, and sends a weekly email report.

The goal of this project is to practice working with external APIs, time-based data filtering, basic automation pipelines, and email delivery. It simulates a lightweight backend workflow that could later be expanded into a larger news aggregation or notification system.
